 developed a Tic-Tac-Toe game, a classic and simple game played on a 3x3 grid. In this game, two players take turns placing their marks—either an "X" or an "O"—in the empty spaces on the grid. The goal is to get three of your marks in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, before your opponent does.

This project includes an easy-to-use interface where you can click on the grid to place your mark. The game will automatically check for a winner or a tie, making it simple to play and enjoy.

It's a fun way to practice strategy and quick thinking, and it’s designed to be straightforward and user-friendly for anyone who wants to play.
